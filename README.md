# Space-Limited-Coding-Competitions
Note: Java and JavaScript aren't the same thing.

A curated list of coding competitions, active or not, that feature space limitations as a primary element, comparable to fantasy by paladin-t (github.com/paladin-t/fantasy), which, as its description says, is a curated list of available fantasy consoles/computers.
